Headline: Why I stopped naming every object I create... 🧐

When we start coding, we’re taught to give every object a name: Light livingRoomLight = new Light();

But in a real-world system—like a Smart Home Hub managing 50+ devices—naming every single one-time command creates "variable clutter" and hangs onto memory longer than necessary.

In my latest project, I built a Smart Automation System that leverages: ✅ Anonymous Objects: Passing objects as parameters directly into methods to keep the code clean and memory-efficient. ✅ The 4 Pillars of OOP: Using Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Polymorphism to build a scalable architecture.

By passing objects anonymously, I ensured that the Hub remains decoupled from the specific device types, making the system incredibly easy to scale. If I add a Smart AC or a Security Camera tomorrow, the core Hub logic doesn't need to change!

How do you handle memory management in your OOP projects? Let’s discuss in the comments! 🚀
